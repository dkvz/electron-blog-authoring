# Electron Blog Authoring
Mostly an experiment about using Electron. And Preact, because React is very hip right now, I don't like it, and I want to change my minde.

## About Photon
I downloaded the pre-compiled Photon release. I have very little interest in processing SASS for this project.

I then copied the whole thing into my "assets" directory as is.

Quick link to available components: http://photonkit.com/components/

### Notes
* Buttons in the toolbar can receive the "active" classe.

## TODO
- [ ] Main.js doesn't have semicolons (copied it from elsewhere) - Can prettier do something for me there?
